## Diabetic Retinopathy Classification with Flask Frontend

This project implements a web application for classifying Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) in retinal fundus images using a pre-trained deep learning model and Flask for the backend.

### Project Overview

This project combines a pre-trained CNN model for DR classification with a user interface built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Users can upload retinal fundus images, and the system will predict the presence and severity of DR based on the model's output.

**Key Components:**

* **Frontend (HTML, CSS, JS):** A user interface designed with HTML, styled with CSS, and potentially uses JavaScript for interactivity. It allows users to upload images, visualize results, and potentially provide feedback.
* **Backend (Flask):** A Python Flask application handles user interaction, image uploads, communication with the pre-trained model, and returns the classification results.
* **Pre-trained CNN Model:** A pre-trained CNN model, trained on a large dataset of retinal fundus images with corresponding DR grades, performs the actual image classification.

**DR Classes:**

The pre-trained model will likely classify the uploaded image into one of several DR classes, such as:

* No DR
* Mild DR
* Moderate DR
* Severe DR
* Proliferative DR

The specific classes and their definitions will depend on the chosen pre-trained model.

### Dataset

A good resource for obtaining a dataset of retinal fundus images with corresponding DR grades is [https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ascanipek/eyepacs-aptos-messidor-diabetic-retinopathy](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ascanipek/eyepacs-aptos-messidor-diabetic-retinopathy). This dataset contains over 92,000 images from various sources and provides labels for each image indicating the presence and severity of DR.

**Choosing a pre-trained model often involves considering the dataset it was trained on.** Ensure compatibility between the DR classes used in your chosen dataset and the model's output classes.

### Benefits

* **Accessibility:** Enables easy access to DR screening for individuals who might not have immediate access to medical professionals.
* **Quick Results:** Provides real-time classification based on the model's prediction.
* **User-Friendly Interface:** Simplifies the DR screening process for users without technical expertise.

### Dependencies

* **Python:** Required for Flask and any additional libraries used for image processing or model interaction.
* **Flask:** Python web framework for building the backend server.
* **HTML, CSS, JS:** Technologies for building the user interface.

**Requirements:**

The specific Python libraries required for this project will be listed in a file named `requirements.txt`.  You can install these dependencies using the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### How to Use

1. **Project Setup:**
    * Clone or download the project repository.
    * Install the required Python libraries using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
    * Develop the Flask app to handle image uploads, model interaction, and result presentation. 
        * The Flask app should process the uploaded image, use the model to predict the DR class, and return the predicted class and potentially a confidence score.
    * Design the user interface using HTML, CSS, and potentially JavaScript.
        * The UI should allow users to upload images and display the predicted DR class and confidence score in a clear and user-friendly manner.
    * Integrate the pre-trained model with your Flask app.
2. **Running the Application:**
    * Run the Flask application using `flask run`.
    * Access the application URL in your browser (typically `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`).
3. **Image Upload and Classification:**
    * Users can upload retinal fundus images through the provided interface.
    * The Flask app processes the image, interacts with the model, and displays the predicted DR class and potentially a confidence score.

**Disclaimer:** This application is for informational purposes only and should not be used for medical diagnosis. Always consult a qualified healthcare professional for any medical concerns regarding DR.


### Additional Notes

* This `README.md` will be further updated with code examples for the Flask app and potential frontend design suggestions.
* Security considerations for handling user-uploaded images will be addressed.
* Resources on pre-trained CNN models for DR classification will be provided, including information about the specific DR classes used by the model.

This project demonstrates a Flask-based web application for DR screening. Remember, the provided results should be used alongside consultations with medical professionals.
